# COMPONENTS OF SYSTEM: 

As mentioned in above figure 1.01 and 
1.02 respectively, this project involves the 
components mainly like Arduino Nano, 
DHT-11 is used to determine the 
temperature and the humidity of the 
atmosphere or the given specified region, 
jumper cables, LCD display (16*2) with 
i2c connection and for power source we 
here in this model have taken 9-volt battery 
as a power source.
